# Computer-Vision
Using Computer Vision to create the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game.
This is a computer vision project. I used Teachable-Machine to create a model with four different classes, namely; Rock, Papers, Scissors and Nothing. Each class was trained with images of myself showing each option to the camera.
