# Computer-Vision
Using Computer Vision to create the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game.
This is a computer vision project. I used Teachable-Machine to create a model with four different classes, namely; Rock, Papers, Scissors and Nothing. Each class was trained with images of myself showing each option to the camera. I created a new virtual environment for this project. In the new environment i installed the necessary requiremnts for the project such as opencv-python, tensorflow, and ipykernel. I started my code by importing the random function. Created a list for three different classes(Rock,Papers,Scissors) and went on to define my get_computer_choice function by using the random.choice method to pick randomly from the list i created. Defined the get_user_choice function by using the input method, which asks the Player to pick their choices and type it in the space provided. The get_winner function was defined by calling both functions defined earlier and by using if-elif-else to tell the computer the rules of the game and how to choose the winner. After that a simulation function was define by calling on the get_winner function.
